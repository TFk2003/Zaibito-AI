    "question": "What is the main objective regarding the properties of the Aga Khan, and what legal processes does it aim to eliminate for succession?",
    "answer": "ZABITO Legal Response:\n\nThe main objective regarding the properties of the Aga Khan, as per the provided documents, is to establish a framework for automatic succession and vesting of these properties. This framework aims to ensure the official recognition and recording of the successor Imam as the owner.\n\nThe legal processes it aims to eliminate for succession include:\n\n*   **Inquiry, Approval, or Conditions:** The Act appears to establish automatic succession and vesting, implying that such processes would not be subject to any inquiry, approval, or condition under any other law (Section 4(1) mentions an exception, thereby implying the general rule).\n*   **Fees and Duties:** No authority shall charge any fee or duty for the mutation, updating, or amendment of revenue records or any other record in connection with such transfer or succession (Section 3(2)).\n*   **Application of Conflicting Laws:** In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Act and any other law, the provisions of this Act shall prevail. Furthermore, nothing contained in any other law for the time being in force shall apply to any matter regulated by this Act.\n*   **Legal Challenge and Jurisdiction:** The Act includes a \"Bar to legal challenge and exclusion of jurisdiction,\" indicating an aim to eliminate legal challenges related to these matters.\n\n**Key Legal Considerations:**\n\n*   The Act, titled \"The Aga Khan Properties (Succession and Transfer) Bill, 2025,\" came into force at once and is deemed to have taken effect on and from 4th February 2025 (Section 1(3)).\n*   While the Act establishes automatic succession, Section 4(1) specifies an exception: \"the provisions of automatic succession and vesting under section 3 shall not apply to any specific property, which the Aga Khan, b[...]\" (the rest of the sentence is not provided). This highlights that certain specific dispositions by the Aga Khan might be exempt from automatic succession.\n*   The Act emphasizes official recognition and recording of the successor Imam as the owner.",

    "question": "Are revenu authorities and other public bodies allowed to demend additional proof or formalities before updating records in the name of the successor Aga Khan?",
    "answer": "ZABITO Legal Response:\n\nBased on the provided documents, revenue authorities and other public bodies are generally **not** allowed to demand additional proof or formalities that would impede or complicate the updating of records in the name of the successor Aga Khan for properties subject to the Act.\n\nThis conclusion is drawn from the following provisions and inferences:\n\n*   **Automatic Succession and Vesting:** The Act establishes a framework for \"automatic succession and vesting under section 3\" (referenced in Section 4(1)). This implies a streamlined process that does not necessitate extensive additional steps or proofs beyond the recognition of the successor Imam.\n*   **Prohibition of Fees and Duties:** \"No authority shall charge any fee or duty for the mutation, updating or amendment of revenue record or any other record in connection with such transfer or-succession\" (Section 3(2)). This provision aims to remove financial and procedural burdens associated with the record update.\n*   **Elimination of Inquiry, Approval, or Conditions:** The Act appears to establish automatic succession and vesting, implying that such processes would not be subject to \"any inquiry, approval or condition under any law\" (as inferred from Section 4(1) which states an exception, thereby implying the general rule). Demanding additional proof or formalities would likely fall under such inquiries or conditions that the Act aims to eliminate.\n*   **Official Recognition and Recording:** The objective is the \"Official recognition and recording of successor Imam as the owner,\" suggesting that once the successor is recognized, the record-keeping process should be ministerial and straightforward.\n\n**Important Caveats:**\n\n*   **Exception for Specific Properties:** Section 4(1) states an important exception: \"the provisions of automatic succession and vesting under section 3 shall not apply to any specific property, which the Aga Khan, b[...]\" (the rest of the sentence is not provided). For such specific properties, the general rule of automatic succession might not apply, and therefore, different procedures or requirements *might* be applicable, though the provided text does not elaborate on what those would be.\n*   **Legal Compliance and Documentation:** While additional *unnecessary* proof or formalities are discouraged, the basic documentation required for the *identification* and *recognition* of the successor Imam, as per the Act, would still be necessary for the authorities to perform the mutation and update records. The Act aims to simplify, not eliminate, the administrative process of recording the recognized successor.\n\n**Summary of Key Legal Considerations:**\nThe Act, titled \"The Aga Khan Properties (Succession and Transfer) Bill, 2025,\" aims to ensure a smooth, automatic, and unburdened process for the succession and vesting of the Aga Khan's properties, with a clear directive against charging fees or duties for record updates. The intent is to minimize external inquiries, approvals, or conditions, thereby limiting the scope for authorities to demand additional, non-essential proof or formalities. However, this does not negate the need for basic documentation to officially recognize the successor Imam, especially considering the exception for specific properties.",

    "question": "What are the property transfer procedures?",
    "answer": "The property transfer procedures, based on the provided legal context, vary depending on the nature of the transfer. The documents detail specific procedures for succession of the Aga Khan's properties, registration of properties under a Trust, and prohibitions related to Benami transactions, along with general provisions for stamp duties on conveyances.\n\nHere are the procedures and relevant details:\n\n*   **For Succession of the Aga Khan's Properties (Act governing Aga Khan succession, specific year not provided):**\n    *   **Automatic Succession and Vesting**: Properties automatically succeed and vest in the successor Aga Khan (Section 3).\n    *   **Exclusions**: The Aga Khan may, during his lifetime, specifically dispose of, bequeath, gift, or otherwise transfer any specific property to a person, entity, or charitable institution other than the succeeding Aga Khan, through a will, trust deed, gift, directive, or other instrument. Such property will then be excluded from automatic succession (Section 4(1) & (2)).\n    *   **Mutation and Record Update**: All authorities in the Province of Sindh, including revenue authorities, municipal bodies, land registries, and development authorities, are mandated to mutate all properties in the name of the successor Aga Khan and update all records to reflect the successor Aga Khan as the lawful owner, *without further inquiry, proof, or formality* (Section 5(1)).\n    *   **Fiscal Exemptions**: The transfer by way of succession and vesting of properties from the Aga Khan to his successor is exempt from stamp duties, registration fees, capital value tax, provincial or local taxes, levies, charges, or any other fiscal imposition. It is also not treated as a transfer for taxation or any financial liability purposes (Section 6(1)).\n\n*   **For Registration of Properties under a Trust (Act governing Trust registration, specific year not provided):**\n    *   **Mandatory Registration**: All movable and immovable properties *must be registered in the name of the Trust under the Registration Act, 1908* (Section 15(1)).\n    *   **Required Details**: The registration of properties must include details of the authors of the trust, beneficiaries, trustee, co-trustee (if any), and any other natural person exercising ultimate effective control over the Trust (Section 15(2)).\n    *   **Certificate of Registration**: The Assistant Director, after fulfillment of legal requirements (as mentioned in sections 13 to 15), shall register the Trust under this Act and issue a Certificate of Registration to the Trustee (Section 16(1)).\n    *   **Refusal of Registration**: The Assistant Director may refuse registration for reasons such as:\n        *   The purpose of the Trust is unlawful or proceeds are suspected to be proceeds of crime (Section 16(2)(i)).\n        *   Any member of the Trust (Author, Trustees, Beneficiary, or person exercising ultimate effective control) is declared proscribed by the Home Department or associated with proscribed organizations under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, or the United Nations Security Council Act 1948 (Section 16(2)(ii)).\n        *   The District Intelligence Coordination Committee considers the Trust a threat to national security (Section 16(2)(iii)).\n        *   Failure to provide complete personal details required under section 13 for registration and functioning of the Trust (Section 16(2)(iv)).\n        *   Any other prescribed reason (Section 16(2)(v)).\n\n*   **Prohibition of Benami Transactions (Act prohibiting Benami Transactions, specific year not provided):**\n    *   **Prohibition**: No person shall enter into any benami transaction (Section 3(1)).\n    *   **Confiscation**: Any property that is the subject matter of a benami transaction shall be liable to be confiscated by the Federal Government (Section 4).\n    *   **Prohibition on Retransfer**: No person being a benamidar shall retransfer the benami property held by him to the beneficial owner or any other person acting on his behalf. Any such retransfer made in contravention of this provision shall be deemed null and void (Section 5(1) & (2)).\n\n*   **General Conveyance and Stamp Duties (Stamp Act, Sindh Finance Act 2006):**\n    *   **Definition of Conveyance**: A \"conveyance\" is defined as an instrument by which property is transferred on sale (Section 2(9) of \"the Act,\" likely referring to the Stamp Act).\n    *   **Test for Conveyance**: A document is considered a conveyance if the intention of the parties was for it to be the sole repository and appropriate evidence of the sale transaction. If it merely recites a past accomplished fact, it is not a conveyance liable to be stamped or registered as such (Commentary on Conveyance, Page 18).\n    *   **Stamp Duty Rates**: Proper stamp duties are applicable to various instruments and property types:\n        *   **Allotment orders or Transfer Allotment orders** (before lease):\n            *   Residential open plots: up to 399 sq.yds. (Ten rupees per Sq:yds); 400 sq.yds or above (Thirty rupees per Sq:yds).\n            *   Commercial plots (Forty rupees per Sq:yds).\n            *   Industrial plots (Twenty rupees per Sq:yds) (Page 10).\n        *   **Buildup property**:\n            *   Residential house (Ten rupees per Sq.ft).\n            *   Residential flats (Five rupees per Sq.ft).\n            *   Commercial offices premises (Fifteen rupees per Sq.ft).\n            *   Industrial units factories (Fifteen rupees per Sq.ft) (Page 10).\n        *   Article 5 was omitted through the Sindh Finance Act, 2006, effective from 01-07-2006 (Page 10).\n    *   **Conveyance of a Right Secured by a Decree**: Stamp duty is regulated by the amount of consideration, falling under S.I. of No. 21 (now No. 16) of the Stamp Act (Page 18).\n\n**Important Caveats:**\n*   The provided documents do not detail a comprehensive, step-by-step procedure for a general property transfer (e.g., a standard sale of property between private individuals) beyond the specific contexts of Aga Khan succession, Trust property registration, and the fiscal aspects of conveyance.\n*   The specific names and years of \"the Act governing Aga Khan succession,\" \"the Act governing Trust registration,\" and \"the Act prohibiting Benami Transactions\" are not explicitly provided in the snippets, though their provisions are detailed.\n*   Compliance with the Registration Act, 1908, is explicitly mentioned for Trust properties and implicitly for conveyances.",

    "question": "What are the property transfer procedures?",
    "answer": "According to the **Karachi Building and Town Planning Regulation (Amendment) (3) (2019), Regulation 2.17**, the property transfer procedures are as follows, depending on the stage of the property:\n\n**I. Transfer of Allotment Before Approval of Completion Certificate:**\n\n1.  **Prior Written Permission**: The allottee must obtain prior written permission from the developer to sublet, transfer, or sell their unit.\n2.  **Outstanding Dues**: The developer shall allow such transfer upon receipt of all outstanding dues up to that time.\n3.  **Transfer Fee**: A transfer fee of 2% of the total price of the unit must be paid.\n\n**II. Sale/Purchase After Obtaining Completion Certificate and Handing Over Possession:**\n\n1.  **Registered Sale Deed**: The sale or purchase of the unit must be made through a registered Sale Deed.\n2.  **NOC from Authority**: The purchaser must obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Authority for transfer/mutation of the unit.\n3.  **Land Controlling Agencies**: This NOC is obtained through the concerned land controlling agencies, such as the Revenue Group of Office of CDGK.\n\n**III. Stamp Duty Requirements for Transfer Instruments:**\n\nStamp duty is a crucial component of the transfer process. The following rates apply to various instruments, as per the provided context (with Article 5 omitted through the Sindh Finance Act, 2006, effective from 01-07-2006):\n\n*   **Allotment Orders or Transfer Allotment Orders (issued by developer, builder, etc.)**:\n    *   **Residential Open Plots**:\n        *   Up to 399 sq.yds: Ten rupees per Sq:yds\n        *   400 sq.yds or above: Thirty rupees per Sq:yds\n    *   **Commercial Plots**: Forty rupees per Sq:yds\n    *   **Industrial Plots**: Twenty rupees per Sq:yds\n*   **Built-up Property**:\n    *   **Residential House**: Ten rupees per Sq.ft\n    *   **Residential Flats**: Five rupees per Sq.ft\n    *   **Commercial Offices Premises**: Fifteen rupees per Sq.ft\n    *   **Industrial Units/Factories**: Fifteen rupees per Sq.ft\n*   **Transfer of Shares in an Incorporated Company or Other Body Corporate**:\n    *   On physical and on withdrawal from the Central Depository Company: 1.5 percent of the face value of shares, subject to a minimum of one rupee.\n    *   Deposited to the Central Depository Company: 0.15 percent of the face value of shares.\n*   **Transfer of Debentures (being marketable securities)**: 3 percent of the face value of debentures, subject to a minimum of two rupees.\n*   **Transfer of any interest secured by a bond, mortgage deed, or policy of insurance**:\n    *   If the duty on such bond, mortgage deed, or policy does not exceed twenty rupees: The duty with which such bond, mortgage deed, or policy of insurance is chargeable.\n    *   In any other case: Thirty rupees.\n*   **Transfer of any property under the Administrator Generals Act, 1913, Section 31**: Thirty rupees.\n*   **Transfer of any trust-property without consideration from one trustee to another trustee or from a trustee to a beneficiary**: Twenty rupees or such smaller amount chargeable under clause (a) to (c) of this Article.\n*   **Exemptions**: Transfers by endorsement of a bill exchange, cheque or promissory note; of a bill of lading, delivery order, warrant for goods, or other mercantile document of title to goods; of a policy of insurance of securities of the Central Government.\n\n**IV. Registration Procedures for Documents Relating to Immovable Property:**\n\nWhile specific years for these sections are not provided, they outline the general administrative procedures for registration:\n\n*   **Procedure where document relates to land in several sub-districts (Section 64)**:\n    *   Every Sub-Registrar, upon registering a non-testamentary document relating to immovable property not wholly situated in his own sub-district, shall make a memorandum thereof, including endorsements and certificates.\n    *   This memorandum is then sent to every other Sub-Registrar subordinate to the same Registrar in whose sub-district any part of such property is situated.\n    *   Such Sub-Registrar shall file the memorandum in his Book No. 1.\n*   **Procedure where document relates to land in several districts (Section 65)**:\n    *   Every Sub-Registrar, upon registering a non-testamentary document relating to immovable property situated in more districts than one, shall forward a copy thereof, including endorsements, certificates, and any map or plan mentioned in Section 21, to the Registrar of every district where any part of such property is situated (other than his own district).\n    *   The Registrar, upon receiving these copies, shall file the copy of the document and map/plan in his Book No. 1.\n    *   The Registrar shall also forward a memorandum of the document to each of the Sub-Registrars subordinate to him within whose sub-district any part of such property is situated, and every Sub-Registrar receiving such memorandum shall file it in his Book No. 1.\n*   **Procedure after registration of documents relating to land (Section 66)**:\n    *   On registering any non-testamentary document relating to immovable property, the Registrar shall forward a memorandum of such document to each Sub-Registrar subordinate to himself in whose sub-district any part of the property is situated.\n    *   The Registrar shall also forward a copy of such document, together with a copy of any map or plan mentioned in Section 21, to every other Registrar in whose district any part of such property is situated.\n    *   Such Registrar, on receiving any such copy, shall file it in his Book No. 1.\n\n⚠️ **Important**:\n*   Compliance with all outstanding dues and payment of the prescribed transfer fee are mandatory before a transfer of allotment can be approved by the developer.\n*   After completion, a registered Sale Deed is essential, followed by obtaining an NOC from the Authority for mutation.\n*   Proper stamp duty, as detailed above, must be affixed to the relevant instruments for legal validity and registration.\n*   The procedures for registration involving multiple sub-districts or districts ensure proper record-keeping across relevant jurisdictions.\n\n📌 **Summary**: As of the latest amendment in 2019, property transfer in Sindh involves distinct procedures depending on whether a completion certificate has been issued. Before completion, developer permission, payment of dues, and a 2% transfer fee are required. After completion, a registered Sale Deed and an NOC for mutation from the Authority are necessary. All transfers are subject to specific stamp duties based on the property type and instrument, and must follow the prescribed registration protocols by Sub-Registrars and Registrars.",

    "question": "What are the property transfer procedures?",
    "answer": "According to the provided documents, property transfer procedures are detailed for specific scenarios, primarily concerning the succession of the Aga Khan, the registration of properties under a Trust, and the stamp duties applicable to various types of transfers.\n\nHere are the property transfer procedures and related requirements based on the context:\n\n### 1. Property Transfer by Succession of the Aga Khan\n\nAccording to the **Aga Khan Properties Act (Year not specified in context, but presented as most recent)**:\n\n*   **Automatic Succession and Vesting**:\n    *   Section 3: All properties held by the Aga Khan automatically succeed to and vest in the succeeding Aga Khan upon his recognition by the Shia Imami Ismaili Muslims, without the need for any inquiry, approval, or condition under any other law.\n*   **Exclusion from Automatic Succession**:\n    *   Section 4(1): The Aga Khan can specifically dispose of, bequeath, gift, or transfer any specific property to a person, entity, or charitable institution other than the succeeding Aga Khan, through a will, trust deed, gift, directive, or any other instrument executed during his lifetime.\n    *   Alternatively, the Aga Khan can inform the Department in writing that certain properties are excluded from automatic succession.\n    *   Section 4(2): Such dispositions take effect according to the instrument and the property is excluded from the Act's operation.\n*   **Mutation by Authorities**:\n    *   Section 5(1): All authorities in Sindh (including revenue authorities, municipal bodies, land registries, development authorities, financial institutions, corporate registries) **shall**, upon commencement of this Act, mutate all properties in the name of the successor Aga Khan and update all records to reflect him as the lawful owner, **without further inquiry, proof, or formality**.\n    *   Section 5(2): The Department circulates the Act's contents to relevant authorities once satisfied that the successor Aga Khan has been duly recognized.\n*   **Exemptions from Duties and Taxes**:\n    *   Section 6(1): The transfer by way of succession of properties from the Aga Khan to his successor, and the vesting of properties in the successor Aga Khan, shall:\n        *   Be exempt from stamp duties, registration fees, capital value tax, provincial or local taxes, levies, charges, or any other fiscal imposition.\n        *   Not be treated as a transfer for taxation or any financial liability under any law relating to property, transfer of property, or revenue records.\n\n### 2. Property Registration for Trusts\n\nAccording to the **Trust Registration Act (Year not specified in context)**:\n\n*   **Registration Requirement**:\n    *   Section 15(1): All movable and immovable properties **must be registered** in the name of the Trust under the Registration Act, 1908.\n    *   Section 15(2): The registration must include details of the authors of the trust, beneficiaries, trustee, co-trustee (if any), and any other natural person exercising ultimate effective control over the Trust.\n*   **Certificate of Registration**:\n    *   Section 16(1): The Assistant Director, after fulfillment of legal requirements (as mentioned in sections 13 to 15), shall register the Trust under this Act and issue a Certificate of Registration to the Trustee.\n*   **Refusal of Registration**:\n    *   Section 16(2): The Assistant Director may refuse registration for reasons to be recorded in writing, including:\n        *   If the purpose of the Trust is unlawful or proceeds are suspected to be proceeds of crime.\n        *   If any member of the Trust (Author, Trustees, Beneficiary, or person exercising ultimate effective control) is declared proscribed by the Home Department or associated with proscribed organizations under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, or the United Nations Security Council Act 1948.\n        *   If the District Intelligence Coordination Committee considers the Trust a threat to national security.\n        *   If the author, Trustee, Beneficiary, or any person acting on their behalf fails to provide complete personal details required under Section 13.\n        *   Any other prescribed reason.\n\n### 3. Stamp Duties on Property Transfers\n\nThe provided documents also detail the proper stamp duty for various instruments related to property transfer, which is a crucial part of the transfer procedure. These duties are generally applicable unless specific exemptions apply (e.g., Aga Khan succession).\n\n*   **Transfer (whether with or without consideration)**:\n    *   (a) Of shares in an incorporated company or other body corporate:\n        *   1.5 percent of the face value of shares (minimum one rupee) on physical transfer and withdrawal from the Central Depository Company.\n        *   0.15 percent of the face value of shares deposited to the Central Depository Company.\n    *   (b) Of debentures being marketable securities: 3 percent of the face value of debentures (minimum two rupees).\n    *   (c) Of any interest secured by a bond, mortgage deed, or policy of insurance:\n        *   The duty with which such bond, mortgage deed, or policy of insurance is chargeable.\n        *   In any other case: Thirty rupees.\n    *   (d) Of any property under the Administrator Generals Act, 1913, Section 31: Thirty rupees.\n    *   (e) Of any trust-property without consideration from one trustee to another trustee or from a trustee to a beneficiary: Twenty rupees or such smaller amount chargeable under clauses (a) to (c) of this Article.\n*   **Allotment orders or Transfer Allotment orders** (issued by a developer, builder, Co-operative Society, housing society, or housing authority):\n    *   **A- In respect of residential open plots**:\n        *   Up to 399 sq.yds.: Ten rupees per Sq:yds.\n        *   400 sq.yds or above: Thirty rupees per Sq:yds.\n    *   **B- In respect of buildup property**:\n        *   Residential house: Ten rupees per Sq.ft.\n        *   Residential flats: Five rupees per Sq.ft.\n        *   Commercial offices premises: Fifteen rupees per Sq.ft.\n        *   Industrial units factories: Fifteen rupees per Sq.ft.\n*   **Exemptions from Stamp Duty**:\n    *   A receipt acknowledging the delivery of immovable property valued more than Rs. 160 is not liable to stamp duty under Article 53 of Schedule 1 (L.R. No. 1078 dated 11\" July 1902. G.R. No. 285 dated 31 July 1902).\n    *   Transfers by endorsement of a bill of exchange, cheque, promissory note, bill of lading, delivery order, warrant for goods, or other mercantile document of title to goods, a policy of insurance, or securities of the Central Government.\n\n⚠️ **Important**: The provided documents detail specific property transfer procedures for the Aga Khan's succession and for properties being registered under a Trust, along with stamp duty requirements for various types of transfers. However, they do not provide a comprehensive, general step-by-step procedure for all types of property transfers (e.g., a standard sale of immovable property between private individuals) beyond the stamp duty implications. Compliance with all relevant laws and documentation requirements is crucial for any property transfer.\n\n📌 **Summary**: As of the most recent laws provided, property transfer procedures are specifically outlined for the automatic succession of the Aga Khan (with exemptions from duties and mandatory mutation by authorities) and for the registration of properties under a Trust (requiring specific details and subject to refusal for certain reasons). Various stamp duties are also prescribed for different types of transfers, including shares, debentures, trust property, and allotment orders. General, comprehensive procedures for all property transfers are not detailed in the provided context.",

    "question": "What documents are needed to register property transfer?",
    "answer": "According to the provided legal documents, the requirements for documents needed to register property transfer differ significantly between the succession of the Aga Khan and the registration of properties under a Trust.\n\n### 1. For the Succession of the Aga Khan\n\nAccording to **The Aga Khan Properties (Succession and Transfer) Act, 2025 (Sindh Act No. IX of 2025)**:\n\n*   **No Traditional Documents Required for Automatic Succession**:\n    *   Section 3(1) explicitly states that all properties situated within the Province of Sindh shall, on the demise of the Aga Khan, automatically and immediately vest in and belong to the successor Aga Khan \"without any probate, succession certificate, letters of administration, court order, registration of any instrument, transfer, mutation or any other legal or administrative formality whatsoever.\"\n    *   Section 5(1) mandates that all relevant authorities in Sindh (including revenue authorities, municipal bodies, land registries, etc.) **shall** mutate all properties in the name of the successor Aga Khan and update all records \"without further inquiry, proof, or formality.\"\n    *   Section 7(4) (Transitional Application) further reinforces this by stating that \"No court, authority, or person shall question or challenge the succession, vesting, or transfer referred to in this Act on any ground whatsoever, including lack of probate, non-registration, or absence of mutation prior to the enactment of this Act.\"\n\n*   **Documents for Specific Exclusions (if applicable)**:\n    *   Section 4(1) provides an exception: if the Aga Khan wishes to specifically dispose of, bequeath, gift, or transfer any property to someone *other than* the succeeding Aga Khan, this must be done through a \"will, trust deed, gift, directive, or any other instrument executed during his lifetime.\" In such a case, this specific instrument would be the required document for that particular disposition.\n\n**Summary for Aga Khan Succession**: For the automatic succession and transfer of properties to the successor Aga Khan, the Act explicitly removes the need for traditional legal documents like probate, succession certificates, or registration instruments. Authorities are mandated to update records based on the Act itself and the recognition of the successor Imam. Specific instruments (like a will or trust deed) are only relevant if the Aga Khan *excludes* certain properties from this automatic succession.\n\n### 2. For Properties Being Registered Under a Trust\n\nAccording to the amendments to **Sindh Act No. XXIX of 2020** (referred to as the Trust Act in the previous conversation):\n\n*   **No Objection Certification (NOC) for Specialized Trusts**:\n    *   Section 12-A(1) states that for the registration of a \"specialized trust,\" the trustee \"shall provide to the Director a No Objection Certification (NOC) from the relevant regulator which shall contain the prescribed information.\"\n*   **Details for Trust Registration**:\n    *   Section 15(2) (as referenced in the previous response) requires that the registration of properties in the name of the Trust under the Registration Act, 1908, must include \"details of the authors of the trust, beneficiaries, trustee, co-trustee (if any), and any other natural person exercising ultimate effective control over the Trust.\"\n    *   Section 16(2) (reasons for refusal) and Section 12-A(3) (for pre-existing trusts) imply that \"complete personal details required under Section 13\" must be provided by the author, trustee, beneficiary, or any person acting on their behalf.\n*   **Certificate of Registration**:\n    *   Section 16(1) states that after fulfilling the legal requirements (including those in sections 13 to 15), the Assistant Director shall register the Trust and issue a \"Certificate of Registration to the Trustee.\"\n\n**Summary for Trust Registration**: For properties being registered under a Trust, a \"No Objection Certification (NOC) from the relevant regulator\" is required for specialized trusts. Additionally, the registration process necessitates providing comprehensive details about the trust's authors, beneficiaries, trustees, co-trustees, and any individuals exercising ultimate effective control, including \"complete personal details required under Section 13.\"\n\n⚠️ **Important**: The provided documents do not fully detail the \"prescribed information\" required for the NOC under Section 12-A(1) or the \"complete personal details required under Section 13\" for trust registration. Compliance with all relevant laws and documentation requirements, as may be further specified by rules or notifications, is crucial for any property transfer or trust registration.",

    "question": "How to register property under Registration Act 1908?",
    "answer": "According to the **Amendment of Act No. XVI of 1908** (Sindh Govt. Gazette Ext. Jun. 24, 2024), the process for registering property under the Registration Act, 1908, involves several key steps and considerations, particularly with the introduction of e-registration and *lis pendens* procedures.\n\nHere's how to register property:\n\n1.  **Mandatory Registration of Specific Instruments**:\n    *   An instrument that grants power to an attorney or constitutes an agreement to create, declare, assign, limit, or extinguish, by way of sale, any right, title, or interest of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, in immovable property, **must be registered**. (Amendment of section 17 of Act No.XVI of 1908, sub-section (1)(bb) and sub-section (2)(v), 2024)\n\n2.  **E-Registration Process (Section 32-A, 2024)**:\n    *   **Online Application**: The applicant shall apply online through E-service for registration of the document as per the format and procedure notified by the Inspector General of Registration with the approval of the Board of Revenue. (Page 8, before Section 32-A, 2024)\n    *   **Acknowledgment**: For acknowledgment of the application, the applicant shall instantly be sent an auto-generated SMS and email (if provided) indicating the date, time, type of instrument, and other prescribed details. (Page 8, before Section 32-A, 2024)\n    *   **Title Verification**: The title document pertaining to the land shall be online verified from the database and the ban list posted on the web portal in the public domain and integrated with the system. (Insertion of new section 32-A of Act No. XVI of 1908, sub-section (1), 2024)\n    *   **Uploading Scanned Copy**: If the relevant title document is not available in the database, or if the title is not verifiable due to non-availability of records, the applicant shall upload a scanned copy of the title document. The Sub-Registrar shall inform the applicant via SMS and email (if provided) to upload the scanned copy for verification. (Insertion of new section 32-A of Act No. XVI of 1908, sub-section (2), 2024)\n    *   **Payment of Taxes and Fees**: Applicable taxes and/or fees shall be paid under the relevant laws. (Insertion of new section 32-A of Act No. XVI of 1908, sub-section (3)(i), 2024)\n    *   **Appearance for Execution**: The applicant must appear for the execution of the document. (Insertion of new section 32-A of Act No. XVI of 1908, sub-section (3)(i), 2024)\n\n3.  **Consideration of *Lis Pendens* (Section 17(3), 2024)**:\n    *   **Notice from Court**: In case of any suit, petition, appeal, or other claim affecting any right, title, or interest in immovable property, the court shall issue notice to the Sub-Registrar within whose local limits the property is situated.\n    *   **Sub-Registrar's Action**: Upon receiving such notice or being otherwise informed in writing of the pendency or disposal of such case (and having duly verified it), the Sub-Registrar shall make or remove the entry of *lis pendens* in the record relating to the property.\n    *   **Registration with *Lis Pendens***: At the time of registering any document relating to the right, title, or interest in immovable property, the Sub-Registrar shall record any notice of *lis pendens* in the record. However, the Sub-Registrar **may nonetheless register the document if there is no restraining order from any court or other legal bar to registration**. (Amendment of section 17 of Act No.XVI of 1908, sub-section (3), 2024)\n\n4.  **Appearance of Executants and Witnesses (Registration Act 1908, Sections 36-38)**:\n    *   If the presence or testimony of any person (executant or witness) is necessary for registration, the registering officer may call upon a designated officer or Court to issue a summons requiring their appearance at the registration office. (Section 36, Registration Act 1908)\n    *   The officer or Court, upon receipt of the peons fee, shall issue and cause service of the summons. (Section 37, Registration Act 1908)\n    *   The registering officer may examine any person present in his office to satisfy himself of their identity or for any other purpose contemplated by the Act. (Section 35, Registration Act 1908)\n\n5.  **Refusal to Register (Registration Act 1908, Section 35)**:\n    *   The registering officer shall refuse to register the document if any person by whom it purports to be executed denies its execution, or appears to be a minor, an idiot, or a lunatic, or if a deceased executant's representative or assign denies its execution. (Section 35, Registration Act 1908)\n\n⚠️ **Important**:\n*   The exact format and detailed procedure for online registration are to be notified by the Inspector General of Registration with the approval of the Board of Revenue.\n*   Compliance with all legal requirements, including the provision of complete personal details for authors, trustees, beneficiaries, or any person exercising ultimate effective control, is crucial, especially for properties being registered in the name of a Trust. (Section 15, 16, 17, Trust-related document)\n*   The Sub-Registrar has control over all other Registration Officers in his District, and the Inspector General of Registration has control over all Registration Officers. (Amendment of section 6 of Act No.XVI of 1908, 2024)\n\n📌 **Summary**: As of June 24, 2024, property registration under the Registration Act, 1908, in Sindh, mandates the registration of certain instruments related to immovable property rights. The process now heavily emphasizes e-registration, including online title verification, uploading scanned documents, and payment of fees, followed by physical appearance for execution. The Sub-Registrar must also record *lis pendens* notices from courts but may proceed with registration if no specific restraining order exists.",
