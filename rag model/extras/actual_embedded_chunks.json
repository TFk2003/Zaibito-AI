That brings us to the second question namely on what amount 6 interest is to be calculated in terms of the final judgment. The matter was argued before us on the basis that it was governed by the provisions of section 34 of the Act. However, as this was a case in which the compensation awarded by the Court was in excess of the sum which the Collector had awarded, the case more properly fell to be dealt with under section 28 of the Act. In practical terms, however, the result remains unaffected. Section 34 applies when the amount of compensation is not paid or deposited on or before taking possession of the land. In that case the Collector shall pay the amount awarded with interest thereon at the rate of six per centum per annum from the time of so taking possession until it shall have been so paid or deposited.
